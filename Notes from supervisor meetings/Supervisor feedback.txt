1st supervisor meeting:
- we are looking at the steady state of the function and discarding the dynamics.. argument why not looking at the dynamics.
- how you have found steadystate
- did you filter
- why did you choose this model
- what do you want to use the model for
- model based on steadystate.. so it's not based on time
- affinity model represents a pump very well

Modeling:
- polymoninal estimation
- cf toolbox (matlab curve fitting tool)
- Petar mentioned least square approximation

Experiment:
- running pump at different speed, changing the valve position
- sampling

2nd supervisor meeting:
- valve equation
- validation data set
- another data set to validate
- when curve fitting, what is R-square
- root mean square error, least mean square
- we are (heavily) filtering over a lot of datapoins in the steadysteate, which makes the curve fitting really accurate
- +the physical system does not change much
- calculate the hydrostatic pressure
- data sheet flowmeter
- calibrate sensor of flowmeter
- signal to noise ratio, what is the real signal
- specify a range so that you are not drowning noise
- blackbox model, relying on our measured data (yes)
- use a datadriven approach like siegler-nichols, instead of model based
- link the energy consumption/energy efficiency to the pump
- a bit ambitious, compared to using a pid
- identify operating range, by plotting the power as well
- again, datadriven pid controller
- first order system, how to identify it?

- must be linearized (simplified = loose information = less precise) before you laplace transform it and get the transfer function
- system analysis (bode plot etc, but most precise is still the linear)
- can be implemented using the linear something in matlab
- best way to linearize is taylor serier, apply your equation, apply your nonlinear terms, find your linerisation point
- moodle, control course, lecture about linerisation
- find the uncertaties, are they important or not
- you could be asked wath matlab is doing for you
