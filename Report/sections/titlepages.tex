}{% the abstract
	Our end goal is to control the flow of water in a system consisting of three pumps in parallel.
	A secondary goal is to achieve this with minimal power consumption.
	
	Using more than one pump,
	we can remove the link between flow and power consumption as described in the affinity laws,
	because the peak efficiency gets moved to a higher flow with multiple pumps used in parallel.
	
	it is possible to stepwise change the impeller size,
	while changing the efficiency in a different way. %TODO
	
	We set ourselves a goal of performance for the model,
	and discuss why this goal is reasonable in respect to energy consumption.
	Discussion whether the goal was met or not follows in the same chapter,
	and steps to ensure the goal is hit are explained.
