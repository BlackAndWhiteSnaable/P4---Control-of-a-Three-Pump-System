}{% the abstract
	This report describes two versions of mathematical modelling for pumping systems.
	All data used for the coefficients was gathered on a setup of three identical pumps in parallel,
	but only one pump was used at a time.
	
	In the early stages of the project the goal was to use all three pumps for energy efficiency,
	this was however not done because of the limited time frame.
	
	Instead a PID controller was implemented and tuned with the Ziegler Nichols method.
	The coefficients were based on experimental data gathered on aforementioned setup.
	
	Additionally a static model of the head relative to the flow was developed.
	
	The final controller implementation is done with
	Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered{}} Real-Time\texttrademark{},
	on a target PC.
