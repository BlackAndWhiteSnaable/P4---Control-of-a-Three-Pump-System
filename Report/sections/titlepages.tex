}{% the abstract
	Here should be an abstract
	but we didn't write a good one yet.
	
	Our end goal is to control the flow of water in a system 
	consisting of three pumps in parallel.
	
	A secondary goal is to achieve this with minimal power 
	consumption.
	
	To minimise power consumption, the relations described in 
	the affinity laws are used,
	specifically power being proportional to the cube of flow.
	
	Using more than one pump, we can effectively change the 
	impeller size online,
	by adding or subtracting one pump at a time.
