\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
The focus of this project is to develop a controller for a system of pumps in such a way,
that a constant flow is achieved with a minimal power consumption.

The main focus is to understand, develop and implement modelling and control techniques.
We will compare different techniques for both modelling and control in this report
and conclude why specific techniques fit better to our purpose.


Flow control is important in several situations throughout many industries.
Examples range from the oil and gas sector\cite{OilFlow} over breweries\cite{BrewFlow},
dairy plants\cite{DairyFlow} to waste water treatment plants\cite{WastewaterFlow}.


Controlled flow can be achieved relatively easily by controlling the shaft rotation speed $\omega$,
but this can lead to extreme power consumption.

According to the affinity laws\cite{AffinityLaws}
