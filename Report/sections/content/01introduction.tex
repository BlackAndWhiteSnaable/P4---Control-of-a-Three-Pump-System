\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
The human body is made of 60\% water \cite{HumanWater}.
To remain healthy,
a human needs to consume \todo[color=01introduction]{3,7 l} of water every day.
This amount comes from both drinks and also food.
For food to contain liquid it has to be present,
when the plants are growing,
when they are processed or added in the process of food preparation.
For drinks it has to be transported to the consumer,
in form of bottles, tanks or pipelines.

In all of those processes,
it is important to have a controllable flow,
maybe to meter the usage of water,
or to ensure the stability of a process.

Constant flow can also be important for different industries.
Examples range from the oil and gas sector\cite{OilFlow} over breweries\cite{BrewFlow},
dairy plants\cite{DairyFlow} to waste water treatment plants\cite{WastewaterFlow}.

In every commercial use,
it is important to keep cost low.
The lifetime cost of any system depends both on the initial cost,
but especially the running cost \todo[color=01introduction]{find marketing source}.

The running cost of controlling flow depends largely on the efficiency of the pump used \todo[color=01introduction]{find source for this in VOLK book}.
But the efficiency also depends on the procedure of pumping.

In previous work \todo[color=01introduction]{quote Zhenyu},
it was found that using multiple pumps in parallel can be beneficial to the total efficiency.

But that research only focused on controlling pressure,
and we therefore want to investigate whether this also holds for flow control.

The focus of this report therefore lays on controlling a constant flow,
inside a working range optimized for minimal energy consumption.

%For the water to come into the food,
%plants need to be watered regularly.
%For drinking water (or other liquids), they have to be transported.
%
%In any way, the flow of the water has to be controlled at some point in this chain,
%be it for irrigation or for bottling drinks.
%
%Even though 
%
%The focus of this project is to develop a controller for a system of pumps in such a way,
%that a constant flow is achieved with a minimal power consumption.
%
%The main focus is to understand, develop and implement modelling and control techniques.
%We will compare different techniques for both modelling and control in this report
%and conclude why specific techniques fit better to our purpose.
%
%
%Flow control is important in several situations throughout many industries.
%
%
%Controlled flow can be achieved relatively easily by controlling the shaft rotation speed $\omega$,
%but this can lead to extreme power consumption.
