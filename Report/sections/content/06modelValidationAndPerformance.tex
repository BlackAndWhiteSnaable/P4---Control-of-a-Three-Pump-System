\todo[color=06modelValidationAndPerformance]{Model Validation and Performance}
To validate the model acquired in Chapter \ref{ch:mathmodel}, we ran a second test with the 
same setup as described in Chapter \ref{ch:experiment}. Coefficients were determined for pump models,
for every percentage of the valve opening. As expected, the models are able to approximate the pump
curves, that are closer to the actual pump speed the models were determined for.

Figures XX and XX, represent the Pressure and the Power Consumption for one of the tests.
The coefficients for the model were determined at 60 \% pump speed and can be seen below.

Equation XX represent the modeled Flow and Power Consumption for 60 \% pump speed.
