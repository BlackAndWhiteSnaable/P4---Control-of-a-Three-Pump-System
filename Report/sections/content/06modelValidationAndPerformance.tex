\todo[color=06modelValidationAndPerformance]{Model Validation and Performance}
To validate the model acquired in \ref{ch:mathmodel},
we ran a second test with the same test setup as described in \ref{ch:experiment}.

\todo[color=06modelValidationAndPerformance]{create figures that compare model to data}
\missingfigure{comparison between predictions and test data}

Comparing the simulated results with the gathered data,
we get a fit of \todo[color=06modelValidationAndPerformance]{calculate fit and put here} something.
