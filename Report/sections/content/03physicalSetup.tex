\chapter{Physical Setup}\label{ch:physsetup}

This chapter explains how the setup is built.
Going into detail about the pump type used,
centrifugal pumps, since they determine the major dynamics of the system.
The other components, pipes, valves and sensors are also explained,
but in less detail.

To give a general overview of the setup,
Figure \ref{fig:setup_photo} shows the front view of the setup,
with all three pumps (red and black) and their individual sensors (blue) visible.
Also visible are the control valve, the target computer,
parts of the electrical wiring and parts of the piping.

\end{figure}

Not visible on this photo are the power sensor and the water tank.

A schematic overview of the system is available in Appendix \ref{app:overview}.

This setup was already available for use with student projects
and two other groups used it simultaneously,
which is why no alterations were taken.

\section{Centrifugal Pumps}
A pump is a device used to move liquid through a piping system and to 
raise the pressure of the liquid.
The rise in pressure is often necessary for processes upstream
or to overcome a rise in the pipeline.
We will focus on explaining and describing only centrifugal pumps,
since this is the type of pump present in our setup. 

\subsection{Principle}
In 1689, physicist Denis Papin invented the centrifugal pump. 
It is the most commonly used type of pump, due to its simple construction,
relative low cost, reliability and quiet operation.

The pump is built on a simple principle: Liquid is led to the impeller hub
and by means of the centrifugal force it is flung towards the periphery of 
the impeller. 

Figure \ref{fig:pump_sections} shows two cross sections of a centrifugal pump,
showing the flow of liquid through the pump.

\newpage

The fluid is sucked into the impeller at the impeller eye and flows through
the impeller channels formed by the blades between the shroud and hub.
The blades of the rotating impeller transfer energy to the fluid by
increasing velocity and pressure.

The design of the impeller depends on the requirements for application,
pressure and flow. The impeller is the primary component determining the pump performance. 
Pumps variants are often created only by modifying the impeller.

Changing the impeller size of a pump does not influence all output characteristics equally,
but the change can be modelled with the Affinity Laws.

\subsection{Affinity Laws}
Affinity laws are mathematical relationships that provide a way to estimate the 
changes in performance of a pump, as a result of a change in one of the basic pump variables.
In it's simplest form, the term law, means a principle that has been proven true for all cases.
\todo[color=03physicalSetup]{Still not sure about that sentence with all cases...}

Equations \ref{eq:afflaw1} show the relations between a change in motor speeds $N$
to flow $Q$, head $H$ and power $P$.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)
	\hspace{10mm}
	\frac{H_1}{H_2} = \left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)^2
	\hspace{10mm}
	\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)^3
	\label{eq:afflaw1}	
\end{equation}
\cite{Volk2014}\\\\
Similarly, the equations \ref{eq:afflaw2} show the relation between a change in impeller diameter $D$
to  $Q$, $H$ and $P$.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \left(\frac{D_1}{D_2}\right)
	\hspace{10mm}
	\frac{H_1}{H_2} = \left(\frac{D_1}{D_2}\right)^2
	\hspace{10mm}
	\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{D_1}{D_2}\right)^3
	\label{eq:afflaw2}	
\end{equation}

\subsection{Performance Curves}
Performance curves are a very widespread way to compare pumps
and estimate what pump is needed in a specific application.
We included them in this report,
because they also help understanding the relations of $Q$, $H$ and $\omega P$/$N$.

\subsubsection{Pump Head Curve}
A QH-curve or pump curve defines the head as a function of the flow. 
The flow is the rate of the fluid going through the pump.
It is generally stated in cubic meters per hour ($\frac{m^{3}}{h}$).
Figure \ref{fig:typicalPumpCurve} shows a typical pump head curve.
Interesting to notice is,
that the pressure decreases quadratically with the flow.
This can be explained with the Affinity laws mentioned earlier.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/03physicalSetup/typicalHeadCurve.PNG}
	\caption{Typical Pump Head Curve}
	\label{fig:typicalPumpCurve}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power Consumption Curve}
The power consumption $P_{el}$ is another key factor,
when choosing a pump for an application.
The typical between $Q$ and $P_{el}$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:typicalPowerConsumptionCurve}.
Generally, the power consumption increases with the flow.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/03physicalSetup/typicalPowerConsumptionCurve.PNG}
	\caption{Typical Power Consumption Curve}
	\label{fig:typicalPowerConsumptionCurve}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Efficiency Curve}
The efficiency $\eta$ of a pump is the relation between the power delivered from the pump to the water $P_{hyd}$ and $P_{el}$.
Figure \ref{fig:typicalEfficiencyCurve} shows 
a typical efficiency curve of a pump.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/03physicalSetup/typicalEfficiencyCurve.PNG}
	\caption{Typical Efficiency Curve}
	\label{fig:typicalEfficiencyCurve}
\end{figure}
Noticeable here is,
that $\eta$ does not linearly correlate to $P_{el}$.

\subsubsection{NPSH - Curve (Net Positive Suction Head)}
The Net Positive Suction head (NPSH) is the minimum required pressure that has to be present at the inlet to avoid cavitation.
The NPSH increases with the flow.
Figure \ref{fig:typicalNPSHCurve} shows a typical NPSH - Curve.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/03physicalSetup/typicalNPSHCurve.PNG}
	\caption{Typical NPSH Curve}
	\label{fig:typicalNPSHCurve}
\end{figure}

\section{Pipes}
Pipes are a way of transporting liquids or gasses, inside a controllable environment.
They are used to interconnect the pumps and the tank and other peripherals.
One common analogy compares them to wires in electrical circuits.

Based on their diameters, material and shape,
they introduce resistance to the flow of the pumped medium.
Staying with the analogy to electrical circuits,
this can be compared to the cross sectional area and the specific resistance of a wire material.

\section{Valves}
A valve is a device used to regulate the flow of a gas or liquid through a piping system.
Valves can be actuated by different means, such as air pressure, electric motors or rotary handles.
The valve present in our setup is an \todo[color=03PhysicalSetup]{look up the actual name of the valve}
In our project, we are not using the valve for regulatory purposes,
but only to simulate disturbances in the system.

\section{Sensors}
Sensors were present on the setup. They were used to gather the data used throughout the report 
and closely monitor the system. The data gathered was used to determine various pump curves.

\subsubsection{Flow Meter}
After each pump, a magnetic flow meter is installed to measure the flow, and configured to measure 
cubic meters per hour.
\subsubsection{$\Delta$Pressure Sensor}
Pressure sensors are installed across the pump, measuring the pressure difference between two points.
One located before and the other located after the pump. They are configured tho measure in bars.
\subsubsection{Power Sensor}
A power sensor was used to closely monitor the power delivered to the pumps. The power was expressed
in Watts.
