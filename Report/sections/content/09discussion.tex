During the project, our focus shifted. We aimed at developing a control technique, to achieve a constant flow, employing
all three pumps, and using minimal amount of energy. In the end, using control methods taught during our semester, we have
developed a PID Controller, capable of maintaining a certain flow, employing only one pump.

We believe, our initial goal was a high one. However possibly not achievable at our level and with our level of knowledge.
Such goals were previously achieved by researchers present at this university. 

During the project, we have gained a lot of insight into pumps, and were able to apply principles and knowledge
learned during the semester. This has benefited us greatly, since pumps are used in various systems throughout the industry.

Our belief is that, further work can be done on the same setup, in upcoming semesters, aiming at our initial goal and
even setting higher ones.
