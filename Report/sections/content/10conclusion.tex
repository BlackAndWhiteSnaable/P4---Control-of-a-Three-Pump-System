From the Problem Delimitation in Chapter \ref{ch:probdesc} there were three primary goals for this project.

A dynamic model was created according to a very simple transfer function.
All variables were gathered through a step response test.
This helped achieve a dynamic model very similar to the system response throughout the whole operating range.

The development of a static model through polynomial fitting helped understand the pumps capabilities and set a reasonable setpoint for controller testing.
It also made it possible to get an idea of the power consumption and will help in future work towards efficiency optimisation.

All stated requirements were hit,
even though we conclude they might not fit to \cite{Franklin2014} real world requirements.

As stated in Section \ref{sec:future} possible future work could be aiming towards energy efficiency.
Some steps required in that direction would be better modelling and more complex control.
The final goal for a better controller could be maintaining a set flow at maximal efficiency,
by using optimal scheduling of multiple pumps in parallel.
